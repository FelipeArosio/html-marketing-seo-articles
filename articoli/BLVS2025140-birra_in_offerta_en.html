    <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">The increase in sales of beer on offer during Black Friday</h3>
    <p>In the period leading up to Christmas and New Year’s Eve, interest in beer on offer clearly grows: many consumers prefer to plan their purchases by taking advantage of substantial discounts on multi-bottle packs. Black Friday craft beer deals make it possible to move from generic products to more distinctive labels, while keeping the final spending still affordable. Boxes such as “BlackFriday 12 bt La Clàsica 0,33 l Er Boquerón” are designed precisely for this kind of need: twelve bottles of craft Golden Ale made with sea water, with immediate shipping and a price reduced by 30% compared to the list price, provide an ideal base for dinners, aperitifs and informal evenings. The clearly indicated stock availability on the product page helps people decide quickly, avoiding surprises at the time of the order.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">How to choose truly convenient deals among beers and bubbles</h3>
    <p>Looking at the many offers circulating online, not all beers on sale are a real bargain. To assess whether Black Friday craft beer promotions are worthwhile, it is useful to check a few key elements: the original price, the discount percentage, the number of bottles included and the beer style. In the case of Er Boquerón La Clàsica, for example, Vinoso.Shop offers both the 12-bottle promotional box and the single La Clàsica 0.33 l and 0.75 l bottles, allowing you to compare the cost per unit immediately. By integrating these craft beers with a selection of sparkling wines – from metodo classico to fresher sparkling wines – you can create a balanced beer and bubbles mix suitable for all festive occasions. In this way, the discount is not just a number, but becomes a tool for building a smart drinks selection at home.</p>

    <h2 style="margin-top:30px;">Beer on sale: what to know before buying online</h2>

    <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">Differences between craft beer, industrial beer and premium beer</h3>
    <p>Before taking advantage of beer promotions, it is useful to clarify some differences between the main categories found on virtual shelves. Craft beer, such as the one offered by Er Boquerón, stands out for its carefully managed production processes, smaller batches and greater attention to raw materials. Industrial beers, on the other hand, focus on consistency and large volumes, with more standardised flavour profiles. There is also a segment of premium beers which, although produced in significant quantities, devote particular care to taste and positioning. In the context of Black Friday craft beer on Vinoso.Shop, the possibility of reading detailed technical sheets helps to understand where each label sits, so you can choose consciously according to your budget and personal preferences.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">How to interpret price, format and discounts in Black Friday craft beer promotions</h3>
    <p>When analysing a beer offer, three elements immediately become decisive: bottle size, discount percentage and final price per litre. A promotion such as “BlackFriday 12 bt La Clàsica 0,33 l Er Boquerón” clearly shows the price drop from 44.40 to 31.08 euros, with a 30% reduction on twelve bottles of craft beer made with sea water. Comparing this figure with the price of the single La Clàsica 0.33 l or 0.75 l bottles makes it possible to understand whether it is better to choose the box or a mixed purchase. At the same time, evaluating the alcohol content and style – a fresh, easy-drinking Golden Ale – helps to understand how often the beer will be served, and therefore whether the volume of the pack suits your habits.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">Why Golden Ale is a versatile choice for every palate</h3>
    <p>The Golden Ale style, to which Er Boquerón La Clàsica belongs, works extremely well in Black Friday beer promotions. It is a pale style with moderate alcohol content – in the case of La Clàsica, 4.8% – and a balanced sensory profile capable of appealing to different tastes. This craft beer made with sea water combines a pleasant structure with fresh savouriness, with notes of malt, biscuit and iodised hints that recall the Mediterranean. It is precisely this versatility that makes Golden Ale ideal for serving at aperitifs, informal evenings and festive moments, especially when included in a beer and bubbles mix that offers more pairing options at the table.</p>

    <h2 style="margin-top:30px;">The best Black Friday beers on offer: focus on Er Boquerón</h2>

    <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">La Clàsica Er Boquerón: craft beer made with sea water</h3>
    <p>La Clàsica by Er Boquerón is a craft beer produced using sea water from selected areas of the Mediterranean Sea, characterised by clear waters rich in marine flora. The recipe is based on a few essential ingredients: water, barley malt, hops, yeast and sea water. The beer is neither filtered nor pasteurised and undergoes double fermentation, with the second fermentation taking place in the bottle and creating a natural yeast sediment. In the glass it appears coppery, with orange highlights and fine bubbles; on the nose, notes of malt and biscuit emerge, together with iodised aromas, hints of saffron, dried grass and ripe fruit. On the palate, balanced salinity and balsamic notes reminiscent of liquorice stand out, making it a truly unique Golden Ale.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">Black Friday craft beer: 12-bottle box –30%</h3>
    <p>Among the beers on offer on Vinoso.Shop, the “BlackFriday 12 bt La Clàsica 0,33 l” box represents the core of the Black Friday craft beer campaign dedicated to Er Boquerón. The pack includes twelve 0.33 l bottles of Golden Ale made with sea water, with 4.8% alcohol content and a plain glass bottle. The discount applied reduces the price from 44.40 to 31.08 euros, with immediate shipping and availability indicated as 25 items in stock. This format is particularly interesting for those who want to organise aperitifs, informal dinners or sea-themed evenings, offering guests a craft beer that is uncommon in both style and origin. Purchasing the box also means having a ready supply to pair with sparkling wines and bubbles throughout the festive season.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">Differences between La Clàsica 0.33 l and 0.75 l: which format to choose?</h3>
    <p>In addition to the box dedicated to Black Friday craft beer, Vinoso.Shop offers La Clàsica Er Boquerón in two single formats: 0.33 l and 0.75 l. The smaller 0.33 l format, also available in large quantities, is perfect for quick aperitifs, tastings with several beers and for those who like to change label often. The 0.75 l version, on the other hand, is better suited to shared dinners, large tables and occasions when a single bottle is meant to accompany several courses. Both formats maintain the same technical characteristics – craft beer made with sea water, 4.8% alcohol, double fermentation – but meet different serving needs. Adding both to the cart allows you to better manage pairings, especially when planning a beer and bubbles mix with distinct roles at the table.</p>

    <h2 style="margin-top:30px;">Craft beer made with sea water: what makes it unique in the world of beers on offer</h2>

    <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">What purified sea water is and why it is used in beer</h3>
    <p>In the case of Er Boquerón, the definition “sea water beer” refers to the use of pure sea water, treated and selected from Mediterranean areas known for the quality of their waters and marine flora. The addition of sea water, combined with fresh water in the recipe, helps to create a natural salinity and a particular aromatic finesse, without compromising the beer’s drinkability. For those who want to take advantage of Black Friday craft beer deals to try something different, the presence of such a distinctive ingredient makes Er Boquerón a unique choice compared to traditional beers, while still maintaining an accessible style like Golden Ale.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">Typical aromatic profiles of Er Boquerón beers</h3>
    <p>The descriptions on the technical sheets of Vinoso.Shop highlight the sensory complexity of Er Boquerón La Clàsica. Its coppery colour with orange highlights is accompanied by fine bubbles and a full yet not heavy body. On the nose, notes of malt and biscuit can be recognised, together with iodised hints that recall the sea, saffron, dried grass and abundant fruit. On the palate, well-balanced salinity and balsamic aromas reminiscent of a liquorice stick emerge, with a clean and persistent finish. For those looking for beer on offer without giving up complexity and originality, these elements are a real added value, especially when compared with more standardised products.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">Why it is perfect in a “beer and bubbles” mix for parties and aperitifs</h3>
    <p>Within a Black Friday selection that combines beer on offer and bubbles, Er Boquerón La Clàsica can play a very specific role. Its savouriness and iodised notes pair naturally with fish dishes, light fried foods, tapas and finger food, while its full body and balsamic aromas also support richer preparations. Alongside sparkling wines and Champagne chosen for toasts, this craft Golden Ale made with sea water becomes a valid alternative for those who prefer beer but still want a curated tasting experience. In this way, the beer and bubbles mix proposed for Black Friday becomes an extra tool for creating varied aperitifs, themed menus and sea-inspired evenings even in the colder months.</p>

        Black Friday beer promotions can be very convenient, especially when they involve multi-bottle packs of craft and premium beers. The deal is truly worthwhile if the discount is applied to products that are already good at full price and if the quantity purchased matches your drinking habits. Boxes such as the Er Boquerón La Clàsica pack, with twelve bottles of craft sea water beer and a 30% discount, offer significant savings compared to buying single bottles. It is always advisable to check the price per litre, the production date and the product quality to be sure that the promotion is genuinely advantageous.

        The choice between a discounted beer box and single bottles depends on how and how often you drink beer. Discounted boxes, such as the one dedicated to La Clàsica 0.33 l, are ideal for those who are planning aperitifs, dinners and parties with several people, or for those who want to have a stock to enjoy over a few weeks. Single bottles, in 0.33 or 0.75 l formats, are instead perfect for focused tastings, to try new products or for those who drink beer only occasionally. An intermediate solution can be to combine a promotional box with a few single references, so you have a reliable base and some different labels to experiment with.

        Craft beer works very well with Christmas dinners, especially when you choose styles with good structure and personality. A Golden Ale made with sea water such as Er Boquerón La Clàsica can accompany fish starters, fried dishes, Mediterranean-inspired recipes and tapas served as entrées. More full-bodied beers can be paired with meat mains, aged cheeses and rich, flavourful dishes. Including beer on offer from Black Friday in your Christmas menu, alongside bubbles and wines, allows you to offer guests a quality alternative while maintaining variety and interest throughout the meal.
